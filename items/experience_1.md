## ☆ Editor in Chief For High School Yearbook

In High school I was the Head Editor for our school’s yearbook. I was given that role due to the fact that I was a very active member in the club considering the fact that there were barely any other members in the club. One of my favourite memories was when I received a Christmas card from the teacher that ran the club. She was one of the only teachers I connected with at school and I felt as if I could ask her for advice with anything. Due to the fact that creating a yearbook was a lot of work, there were a lot of stressful moments. I will say though that even though there were tough times, I still really enjoyed the process and seeing our product be published. As some would say the fruits of our labor paid off!

**Rating: B+** <br>
Overall I give a ranking of this experience a B+ and not an A due to the stress and time crunch, but also not the worst thing I’ve experienced.
